# Prediction-defects-with-Poisson-Distribition
The total number of cases by years was estimated by processing the defect data given in this project.

In each year from 2000 to 2019, the number of manufacturing defects in auto manufacturers were counted.
The data was collected from 14 different auto manufactory companies. The numbers of defects for the companies are indicated in 14 columns following the year column.
Assume that the number of manufacturing defects per auto company per year is a random variable having a Poisson(Î») and that the number of defects in different companies or in different years are independent.
